# Wise MMDC - Student Expense Comparison

## Project Description

**Status:** Milestone 2 - Interactive Website (Submission)

This project is a web application designed for the **MO-IT120 - Web Systems and Technology** course. Its primary goal is to help Filipino students compare the monthly expenses of a traditional, on-campus learning setup versus an online learning setup, like the one at MMDC.

The application provides an **interactive calculator** where students can input their income and typical expenses for both scenarios to see a direct comparison of their remaining balance in real-time.

This tool aims to help students make more informed financial decisions about their education path.
